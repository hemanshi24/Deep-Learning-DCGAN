# Deep-Learning-DCGAN

# **Generator**

A neural network model called the generator in a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) is in charge of producing fresh data samples that closely match the training data. The generator converts random noise into useful data samples, such pictures, from its input.

The generator part of a DCGAN is initialised and configured by this code, which also makes sure it's installed on the proper hardware (CPU or GPU) and may even be parallelized over many GPUs. After applying weight initialization, the architecture of the generator is written out for examination.

# **The Discriminator**
A neural network model called the discriminator in a DCGAN is in charge of differentiating between produced and actual data samples. It predicts whether input data is produced or real based on input data, regardless of whether it is genuine or generated. In order to gradually increase its capacity to distinguish between created and genuine data, the discriminator is trained in an adversarial manner alongside the generator.
